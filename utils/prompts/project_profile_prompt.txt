You will be given a plain-English project description. Produce a JSON object, that extracts the structured project profile. Refer to the given schema: SCHEMA (required JSON fields and types - mandatory): { "name": string | null, "budget_inr_per_month": number | null, "description": string | null, "tech_stack": { "frontend": string | null, "backend": string | null, "database": string | null, "storage": string | null, "monitoring": string | null, "analytics": string | null }, "non_functional_requirements": [ string, ... ]  // array possibly empty} Example (input -> output): INPUT :We are building a food delivery app for 10,000 users per month. Budget: ₹50,000 per month. Tech stack: Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, object storage for images, monitoring, and basic analytics.Non-functional requirements: scalability, cost efficiency, uptime monitoring. OUTPUT : "name": "Food Delivery App", "budget_inr_per_month": 50000, "description": "A scalable food delivery platform serving ~10k monthly users.", "tech_stack": {   "backend": "Node.js",   "database": "PostgreSQL",   "storage": "Object Storage (images, media)",   "monitoring": "Basic uptime & performance",   "analytics": "Basic user analytics" }, "non_functional_requirements": ["Scalability", "Cost efficiency", "Monitoring"] IMPORTANT: Output only JSON, no additional text, comments - nothing but only the JSON output. If any field is not present in the INPUT, set it to null or [] (for arrays). Capture all functional and non-functional requirements in the description and add them in the output. DO NOT miss out on any features in the description. Try not changing the schema drastically, but NOT AT THE COST OF MISSING OUT IMPORTANT DETAILS. Add any features not mentioned in the above schema but present in the description, like caching, infrastructure, APIs etc. Mandatorily keep "name", "budget_inr_per_month", "tech_stack", "non_functional_requirements" in the output, but also add any additional tech-stack or other features that are found in the description. NOW PROCESS THE INPUT BELOW — produce JSON only. Project description:
