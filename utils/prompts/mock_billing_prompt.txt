You are a strict JSON generator. ALWAYS output valid JSON and NOTHING else (no explanation, no markdown, no code fences).   Produce a *billing report* from a given `project_profile.json`. Be *cloud-agnostic* (use generic service names like Compute, Database, Storage, Networking, Monitoring, Cache, LoadBalancer, Backup, Logging, Worker) and *budget-aware* (cost totals should be plausibly near the project's monthly budget). If you cannot infer a value, use `null` for single fields, `[]` for arrays, or `""` for empty strings. Do not add any fields outside the required schema. Output *one* JSON object with two keys: 1. `"billing_records"` — an array of *12–20* billing record objects (see record schema below). 2. `"billing_summary"` — an object summarizing totals and budget comparison (see schema below). Use INR numeric amounts for all `cost_inr` values. Use month format `"YYYY-MM"` (choose a single representative month, e.g., `"2025-01"`). Keep values realistic and consistent: `cost_inr` should equal (usage_quantity × implied unit price) roughly — you may choose reasonable prices for units but keep the whole dataset plausibly aligned to the project's `budget_inr_per_month` (within ±15%). If budget is not given in the project profile assume realistic budgets based on the model complexity. Ensure distribution across the categories: Compute, Database, Storage, Networking, Monitoring must all appear. Create unique `resource_id` strings and short human-friendly `desc` fields. REQUIRED RECORD SCHEMA (each element in billing_records array must follow this exactly): {  "month": "YYYY-MM", // e.g. "2025-01"  "service": "Compute|Database|Storage|Networking|Monitoring|Cache|LoadBalancer|CDN|Backup|Logging|Worker|etc.",  "resource_id": "string", // unique id like "i-web-01" or "db-main-01"  "region": "string or null", // e.g. "ap-south-1" or null  "usage_type": "string or null", // e.g. "vCPU-hours", "GB-month", "GB-egress", "requests"  "usage_quantity": number, // numeric quantity (no units) "unit": "hours|GB|requests|count|GB-month|IOPS", "cost_inr": number, // numeric INR cost for that line "desc": "short human-friendly description"} REQUIRED SUMMARY SCHEMA (billing_summary): { "budget_inr": number | null, // copy from project_profile budget_inr_per_month if present  "total_cost_inr": number, // sum of all cost_inr "percent_of_budget": number | null, // (total_cost_inr / budget_inr)*100 rounded to 1 decimal if budget given, else null "top_3_services_by_cost": [ "Compute", "Database", "Storage" ] // array of top 3 service names ordered by cost} CONSTRAINTS & GUIDELINES: 1. Produce *12–20* records in `"billing_records"`. Fewer or more will be considered invalid. 2. The dataset must be *cloud-agnostic* (do NOT mention AWS/Azure/GCP-specific SKUs or exact product names). Use generic names (Compute, Database, Storage, etc.). 3. Be *budget-aware*: if `budget_inr_per_month` exists in the provided project profile, make `total_cost_inr` plausibly near that budget (aim for within ±15%). If the profile includes a range (e.g., "60–70k"), pick a representative budget (use mid-point). 4. Ensure *distribution across categories*: include at least one record each for Compute, Database, Storage, Networking and Monitoring. The rest may include Cache, LoadBalancer, CDN, Backup, Logging, Worker. 5. Values must be *numerical* (no commas or currency symbols) and reasonable (e.g., compute usage 100–1,000 hours per resource; storage 10–2000 GB; networking usage in GB). Costs should reflect plausible unit-price multiplication. 6. Resource IDs should be *unique* and human-readable (use project name hints if present, e.g., `foodapp-web-01`). 7. Use `"month"` the same across all records (single representative month). 8. The output must be valid JSON that exactly matches the schema above (no extra fields at top-level other than `billing_records` and `billing_summary`). EXAMPLE (for guidance only — DO NOT output this example, only produce JSON following the required schema): INPUT example profile: { "name": "Food Delivery App", "budget_inr_per_month": 50000, "description": "...", "tech_stack": { "backend": "Node.js", "database": "PostgreSQL", "storage": "Object Storage (images)" }, "non_functional_requirements": ["Scalability","Cost efficiency","Monitoring"] } Desired output structure: { "billing_records": [ {"month":"2025-01","service":"Compute","resource_id": "foodapp-web-01","region":"ap-south-1","usage_type":"Linux/UNIX(on-demand)" "usage_quantity":720,"unit":"hours","cost_inr":900,"desc":"Frontend web server"},  ...  (12-20 records) ], "billing_summary": { "budget_inr":50000, "total_cost_inr":49980, "percent_of_budget":99.96, "top_3_services_by_cost":["Compute","Database","Networking"] } } NOW: Using the given project profile generate the JSON output described above. Output EXACTLY one JSON object and NOTHING else. Don't crumble the entire output JSON in a single line, add line breaks when required to enhance readability. Project Profile:
