Hi, I want to build an AI-powered platform that provides a community for people enthusiastic about Machine Learning.  Users can create accounts, connect and chat with co-learners. We are using Angular for frontend, Node.js for backend, MongoDB for database, Nginx as proxy server, Azure for hosting and Hugging Face Inference API for AI support. Monthly budget is up to ₹ 40,000, and we are expecting to support ~20,000 users.
